# First Aid LLM based Helpline 

This project leverages a large language model (LLM) to provide first aid advice during emergencies. It is integrated with a helpline number, allowing callers to explain their situations and receive appropriate first aid guidance from the LLM.

This service is especially valuable because ambulances typically take around 20 minutes to arrive, and the provided first aid instructions are easy to follow, even for individuals without prior training. Given the widespread lack of first aid knowledge, many patients do not receive necessary care before an ambulance arrives.

First aid is a critical step in emergency response, yet many individuals lack the knowledge to provide it. This project aims to address this gap by offering accessible and multilingual first aid advice via a helpline. It currently supports English and Hindi, making first aid more accessible and potentially reducing fatalities by providing crucial instructions immediately after an accident.
